# HelpTickets
HelpTickets is a plugin dedicated to helping fight bugs on servers. Player's can file their own reports and staff can evaluate these reports, changing the priority and deleting useless ones.

This wont be finished, I don't see any point in attempting to continue something which isn't really good code and not worth it to update.
